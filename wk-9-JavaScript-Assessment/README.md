JavaScript Methods:
JavaScript methods are functions that are associated with objects. They allow manipulation and interaction with data structures or objects. For instance, array methods like push, pop, splice, and string methods like toUpperCase, split, enable efficient data manipulation and transformation.

Functions:
Functions in JavaScript are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They can take parameters as inputs, execute a set of statements, and optionally return a value. Functions are fundamental for structuring code, promoting reusability, and maintaining a modular approach to programming.

Control Flow Expressions:
Control flow in JavaScript involves statements that determine the execution path of a program. Key control flow expressions include:

Conditional Statements (if-else): Executing code based on certain conditions being true or false.
Loops (for, while, do-while): Repeatedly executing a block of code until a certain condition is met or for a specified number of iterations.
Switch Statements: Selecting one of many code blocks to be executed.
These expressions enable developers to control how the code behaves based on different conditions and iterations.

Parameters:
Parameters in JavaScript are variables listed as a part of a function definition. They represent values that the function expects to receive when it is called. Parameters allow functions to be versatile by accepting different inputs, which can then be used within the function's code block.
